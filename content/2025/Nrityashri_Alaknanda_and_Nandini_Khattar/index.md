**Saadhana 2025** continued our tradition of inviting young artists from a senior Guru’s school, to present a different art form and showcase their talen. Such an experience enriches the audience’s immersion in dance, and expands the horizons for parents and family too.

The second presentation by guest artists this year was of **Kathak**, performed by [**Nrityashri Alaknanda ji**](#nrityashri-alaknanda)'s student [**Nandini Khattar**](#nandini-khattar).
