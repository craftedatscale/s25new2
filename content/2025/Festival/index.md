In 2025, the festival featured performances that showcased stories from our mythology, with oral narrative transformed using music and dance as a form of expression.

_Saadhana_, meaning a dedicated and disciplined way of learning, also means practice, hard work, resilience and single-mindedness, attributes that were incorporated in the performances.
