**Saadhana 2025**'s opening piece was **Nottuswaram**, composed by Muthuswami Dikshitar.<br />
<br />
With a unique Western touch, its simple phrases make it easily understandable, musically and emotionally. The piece focuses on Ganesha, the son of Parvati and Shiva, who increases knowledge, and whose _vaahan_ is the mouse.<br />

_Performed by **Amyra, Gaura, Naira, Naomika, Sharanya** and **Tiyasha.**_
