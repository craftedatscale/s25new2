Saadhana 2025 featured performances by [junior and senior students of our Academy](/2025/our_students/).
{{< /lead >}}
These covered varied age groups, from new students to those who have continued their dance education and others that have been learning for a decade. Many long-term students are also working professionals, and their love for dance drives them to take time out of their busy schedules to practice and perform.<br/>

The proceedings were also graced by [exceptional guest artists, each a disciple of a noted Guru](/2025/guest_artists).
{{< /lead >}}
Saadhana 2025 continued our tradition of inviting young artists from a senior Guru’s school, to present a different art form and showcase their talent. Such an experience enriches the audience’s immersion in dance, and expands the horizons for parents and family too.
