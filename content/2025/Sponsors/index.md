Conglomerates, corporations and business houses have historically played a prominent role in  our country's rich traditions of art and culture. Recognizing culture as part of our heritage and legacy, their support has enabled preservation of the performing arts, nurturing of young talent, scapacity building for individuals and groups, and skill development in ancillary sectors.

### Since its inception, _Saadhana_ has been blessed with  encouragement and support from sponsors, patrons and the dance community.

In 2025, Shreyasi Gopinath Dance Academy was delighted and grateful for support from numerous esteemed sponsors, like **IndianOil Corporation, National Thermal Power Corporation, Accessorize with Ruhnaal** and the **Kunwar Viyogi Memmorial Trust**.

It is said that no support — especially from an organization — must be taken for granted. In contemporary times, there is much hard work involved in receiving a corporate gift, major or minor. Shreyasi Gopinath Dance Academy works diligently to nurture bonds with its corporate partners and create visibility for them.
