Shreyasi Gopinath founded the eponymous Shreyasi Gopinath Dance Academy in 2014 and imparts Bharatanatyam training to beginners, adults, seniors and differently-abled, at two prominent locations in the National Capital Region. She also conducts online teaching sessions for students from USA, France, Russia, Dubai, and Mexico.

### Shreyasi's aim is to preserve India's cultural traditions through her teaching and performances, and to cultivate a community that not only produces exceptional dancers but also well-rounded individuals who carry the values of teamwork, respect and perseverance into their lives.

Her senior students are recipients of the Young Dancer Scholarship from Ministry of Culture, Government of India. They have won accolades at national and international dance competitions.
